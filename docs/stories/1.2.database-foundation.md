# Story 1.2: Database Foundation with SQLModel and Migrations

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** PostgreSQL database schema with SQLModel models and Alembic migrations,
**so that** I can store books, screenshots, chunks, and embeddings with proper relationships and types.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. SQLModel models created in db/models.py for all tables: Book, Screenshot, EmbeddingConfig, Chunk with proper field types, relationships, and constraints matching the schema from the project brief
2. Book model includes: id (UUID), title, author, kindle_url, total_screenshots, capture_date, ingestion_status, ingestion_error, metadata (JSONB), timestamps
3. Screenshot model includes: id (UUID), book_id (FK), sequence_number, file_path, screenshot_hash, captured_at with unique constraint on (book_id, sequence_number)
4. Chunk model includes: id (UUID), book_id (FK), screenshot_ids (UUID[]), chunk_sequence, chunk_text, chunk_token_count, embedding_config_id (FK), embedding (VECTOR), vision_model, metadata fields
5. EmbeddingConfig model includes: id (UUID), model_name, model_version, dimensions, is_active, created_at
6. Alembic initialized with initial migration script that creates all tables, pgvector extension, and indexes (idx_chunks_book_id, idx_chunks_embedding with ivfflat)
7. Database session management implemented in db/session.py with async engine and async session factory
8. Local PostgreSQL database (mpp_minerva_local) can be created and migrated successfully with `alembic upgrade head`
9. Basic CRUD operations work: can create/read Book and Screenshot records

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema

The database schema follows the architecture document specifications for PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension. All models use SQLModel for unified database and API schemas.

**Core Tables:**
- **books**: Stores book metadata and ingestion status
- **screenshots**: Stores page screenshots with hashing for deduplication
- **chunks**: Stores semantic text chunks with vector embeddings
- **embedding_configs**: Tracks embedding models used
- **ingestion_logs**: Audit trail for ingestion pipeline

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#database-schema]

### SQLModel Configuration

SQLModel combines SQLAlchemy (database) and Pydantic (API validation) in a single model definition. This eliminates duplicate model definitions between database and API layers.

**Key Patterns:**
- Use `table=True` for database models
- UUID fields with `sa_column=Column(UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)`
- Relationships defined with `Relationship()` from SQLModel
- Timestamps with `default=datetime.utcnow`
- JSONB fields with `sa_column=Column(JSON)`
- Vector fields with `sa_column=Column(Vector(1536))`

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#data-models]

### Async Database Session Management

All database operations must be async to support FastAPI's async capabilities.

**Configuration:**
- Engine: `create_async_engine("postgresql+asyncpg://...")`
- Session: `async_sessionmaker(engine, class_=AsyncSession, expire_on_commit=False)`
- Context manager pattern for automatic cleanup

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#coding-standards]

### Alembic Migration Setup

Alembic manages database schema migrations with version control.

**Important Notes:**
- Configure `env.py` for async migrations
- Import all models before autogenerate
- Set `target_metadata = SQLModel.metadata`
- pgvector extension must be created before tables
- IVFFlat index parameters: `lists = 100` for chunks.embedding

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#database-schema]

### pgvector Configuration

The pgvector extension provides vector similarity search capabilities.

**Requirements:**
- PostgreSQL 15+
- pgvector 0.5+
- Extension must be created: `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`
- Vector type: `VECTOR(1536)` for text-embedding-3-small
- IVFFlat index for performance: `CREATE INDEX idx_chunks_embedding_ivfflat ON chunks USING ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops) WITH (lists = 100);`

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]

### Testing

#### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:** Test each repository method independently with mocked database
- **Integration Tests:** Test full migration up/down, CRUD operations with test database
- **Test Database:** Create mpp_minerva_test database for integration tests
- **Fixtures:** Create pytest fixtures for test database setup/teardown

#### Test Coverage

- Repository CRUD operations: 100%
- Model validation: 100%
- Migration scripts: Manual verification
