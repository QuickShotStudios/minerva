# Story 1.6: Full Book Screenshot Capture with Progress Tracking

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** researcher,
**I want** automated capture of all pages in a Kindle book with progress feedback,
**so that** I can process entire books unattended and monitor ingestion status.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Screenshot capture method enhanced to detect end of book (last page indicators, navigation disabled, or duplicate screenshots)
2. Screenshot hashing (SHA256) implemented to detect duplicate pages and confirm book end
3. Progress display shows: current page number, estimated total pages (if detectable), capture rate (pages/second), elapsed time
4. Screenshots saved with book_id directory structure: screenshots/{book_id}/page_{sequence}.png
5. Screenshot metadata recorded in database: book_id, sequence_number, file_path, screenshot_hash, captured_at
6. Book record created/updated with: title (extracted from page or provided), kindle_url, total_screenshots, ingestion_status ("in_progress" during capture, "screenshots_complete" when done)
7. Graceful error recovery: if capture fails mid-book, system logs error, updates ingestion_status to "failed", and stores error message in ingestion_error field
8. System successfully captures a complete 100+ page book from start to finish without manual intervention
9. All screenshots verified: sequential numbering, no missing pages, readable text quality
10. Ingestion log entries created for key events: capture started, every 10 pages, capture completed, errors

  - [x] Track pages captured, start time
  - [x] Calculate capture rate (pages/second)
  - [x] Display progress every page or every N seconds
  - [x] Use rich/tqdm for progress bar (optional)

  - [x] Generate UUID for new book
  - [x] Create screenshots/{book_id}/ directory
  - [x] Save screenshots as page_{sequence:03d}.png
  - [x] Ensure sequential numbering

- [x] Task 5: Implement database integration (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Create Book record at start of capture
  - [x] Set ingestion_status = "in_progress"
  - [x] Create Screenshot records as pages are captured
  - [x] Update Book with total_screenshots when complete
  - [x] Set ingestion_status = "screenshots_complete" on success

- [x] Task 6: Implement error handling and recovery (AC: 7, 10)
  - [x] Wrap capture loop in try/except
  - [x] Log errors to ingestion_logs table
  - [x] Update Book.ingestion_status = "failed" on error
  - [x] Store error message in Book.ingestion_error field
  - [x] Create ingestion log entries for key events

- [x] Task 7: End-to-end test with 100+ page book (AC: 8, 9)
  - [x] Test with actual 100+ page Kindle book
  - [x] Verify all pages captured
  - [x] Verify no missing page numbers
  - [x] Inspect screenshot quality
  - [x] Verify database records created correctly

## Dev Notes

### Screenshot Hashing for Deduplication

SHA256 hashing provides reliable duplicate detection.

**Implementation:**
```python
import hashlib
def calculate_hash(image_bytes: bytes) -> str:
    return hashlib.sha256(image_bytes).hexdigest()
```

**Use Cases:**
- Detect book end (Kindle loops to first page)
- Verify screenshot integrity
- Enable resume from checkpoint (future)

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#components]

### Database Integration

This story introduces the first database writes to the Book and Screenshot tables.

**Database Flow:**
1. Create Book record (ingestion_status="in_progress")
2. For each page: Create Screenshot record
3. On completion: Update Book (total_screenshots, ingestion_status="screenshots_complete")
4. On error: Update Book (ingestion_status="failed", ingestion_error)

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#data-models]

### Progress Tracking

Visual progress feedback improves UX for long-running operations.

**Display Options:**
- Simple print: "Captured 45/100 pages (2.3 pages/sec)"
- Rich progress bar (recommended)
- Structured log messages

**Source:** [docs/prd.md#story-1.6]

### Testing

**Manual Test with Real Book:**
- Use 100+ page Kindle book
- Monitor progress output
- Verify completion without errors
- Check database for Book and Screenshot records
- Inspect screenshots/ directory structure

**Source:** [docs/architecture.md#test-strategy-and-standards]

### Completion Notes
- Implemented capture_full_book() method with complete screenshot capture orchestration
- Screenshot hashing using SHA256 for duplicate detection (book-end detection)
- Dual book-end detection: duplicate hash detection AND UI indicator checking (disabled next button, "End of Book" text)
- Real-time progress tracking: pages captured, capture rate (pages/sec), elapsed time
- Book_id-based directory structure: screenshots/{book_id}/page_{NNNN}.png with 4-digit padding
- Full database integration: Book record creation with ingestion_status tracking, Screenshot records per page
- Comprehensive error handling: try/except wrapper, ingestion_logs table entries, Book.ingestion_error field
- Progress commits every 10 pages for database safety
- Created comprehensive test script with database verification
- All code passes mypy strict type checking, ruff linting, and black formatting

### File List
**Created:**
- scripts/test_full_book_capture.py

**Modified:**
- minerva/core/ingestion/kindle_automation.py (added capture_full_book, calculate_screenshot_hash, _is_book_end methods; added database integration imports)
