# Story 2.2: Semantic Chunking with Configurable Overlap

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** semantic text chunking with overlap between chunks,
**so that** knowledge is broken into optimal sizes for vector search while preserving context across chunk boundaries.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Semantic chunking module created in core/ingestion/semantic_chunking.py with SemanticChunker class
2. Chunking strategy breaks text at natural boundaries: paragraph breaks, section breaks, or semantic separators (avoid mid-sentence splits)
3. Chunk size target configurable via environment (default: ~500-800 tokens per chunk)
4. Overlap percentage configurable (default: 15%) - each chunk includes last N% of previous chunk text
5. Token counting implemented using tiktoken library to accurately measure chunk sizes
6. Each chunk records: chunk_text, chunk_sequence (order in book), source screenshot_ids (array of screenshot UUIDs this chunk spans)
7. Chunking handles edge cases: very short text (single chunk), very long paragraphs (split intelligently), empty screenshots (skip)
8. Chunk metadata includes: start/end character positions in source text, token count
9. Successfully chunks a full book's extracted text (e.g., 100 pages → ~200 chunks) with validated overlap
10. Manual inspection confirms: no context loss at boundaries, overlap preserves continuity, chunks are semantically coherent
11. All chunks reference correct source screenshots (single screenshot for most chunks, multiple for overlapping chunks)

## Dev Notes

### Chunking Strategy Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Chunk]

**Chunk Model Fields to Populate:**
- `chunk_text`: str - Extracted text content (500-800 tokens typically)
- `chunk_sequence`: int - Order of chunk within book (1, 2, 3...)
- `chunk_token_count`: int - Actual token count using tiktoken
- `screenshot_ids`: list[UUID] - Array of screenshot IDs this chunk spans (typically 1, sometimes 2 for overlapping chunks)

**Chunk Metadata Fields:**
- Start/end character positions in source text (stored in metadata JSONB field)
- Token count (stored in chunk_token_count field)

### File Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Module path: `minerva/core/ingestion/semantic_chunking.py`
- Test path: `tests/unit/test_semantic_chunker.py`
- Utility path: `minerva/utils/token_counter.py` (create helper for tiktoken)

### Token Counting with Tiktoken
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Library: tiktoken 0.5+
- Purpose: OpenAI's official tokenizer for accurate cost estimation
- Encoding: Use `cl100k_base` encoding (matches text-embedding-3-small)

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
import tiktoken

def count_tokens(text: str, model: str = "text-embedding-3-small") -> int:
    encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)
    return len(encoding.encode(text))
```

### Configuration Settings
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Rules]
- Never access environment variables directly
- Use `from minerva.config import settings`
- Add to config.py:
  - `chunk_size_tokens: int = 700` (default target, range 500-800)
  - `chunk_overlap_percentage: float = 0.15` (15% overlap)

### Semantic Chunking Algorithm Details

**Chunking Strategy:**
1. Split extracted text into paragraphs (double newline separators)
2. Group paragraphs into chunks targeting 500-800 tokens
3. For each chunk (after first), prepend last 15% of previous chunk
4. Avoid splitting mid-sentence when possible
5. Track which screenshot(s) each chunk text came from

**Overlap Calculation:**
- If previous chunk is 700 tokens, overlap is 105 tokens (15%)
- Overlap text is the last 105 tokens of previous chunk
- Current chunk = overlap text + new content

**Screenshot Mapping:**
- Input: List of (text, screenshot_id) tuples from extraction phase
- Output: For each chunk, array of screenshot UUIDs it spans
- Most chunks span 1 screenshot
- Chunks near page boundaries may span 2 screenshots

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **All I/O operations must be async** - Chunking is compute-heavy but should be async for consistency
- **Never access environment variables directly** - Use settings
- **Never use print() for logging** - Use structlog
- **File paths must use pathlib.Path**
- **All public functions must have type hints and docstrings**
- **All error logs must include context** - book_id, chunk count, etc.

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Exception Handling:**
- Raise custom `ChunkingError` for chunking failures
- Log warnings for edge cases (very short text, very long paragraphs)
- Never fail silently - always log and raise

**Logging Requirements:**
- Log INFO for successful chunking: total chunks, average size, overlap stats
- Log WARNING for edge cases: very long paragraphs requiring sentence-level splitting
- Log ERROR for failures: empty input, invalid screenshot mapping

### Testing

[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

**Test Framework:**
- pytest 7.4+ with pytest-asyncio for async tests
- Location: `tests/unit/test_semantic_chunker.py`
- Coverage requirement: 80%+ for semantic_chunking.py

**Test Cases Required:**
1. Normal chunking: 10 pages of text → ~20 chunks
2. Very short text (< chunk_size): Returns single chunk
3. Very long paragraph (> chunk_size): Splits at sentence boundaries
4. Empty text: Returns empty list
5. Overlap calculation: Verify 15% overlap applied correctly
6. Token counting: Verify accurate token counts
7. Semantic boundaries: Chunks split at paragraphs, not mid-sentence
8. Screenshot mapping: Correct screenshot_ids assigned to chunks
9. Edge case: Text exactly at chunk boundary (no empty chunks)

**Sample Test Structure:**
```python
# tests/unit/test_semantic_chunker.py
import pytest
from minerva.core.ingestion.semantic_chunking import SemanticChunker

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_normal_chunking():
    # Test with realistic multi-paragraph text
    pass

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_overlap_preservation():
    # Verify last 15% of chunk N appears in chunk N+1
    pass

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_screenshot_mapping():
    # Verify correct screenshot_ids assigned
    pass
```

**Integration Test:**
- Use extracted text from real book (100 pages)
- Validate chunk count (~200 chunks for 100 pages)
- Manual inspection of random chunks for coherence

**CI Integration:**
- Tests run on every push via GitHub Actions
- Must pass: `pytest tests/unit/test_semantic_chunker.py -v --cov=minerva.core.ingestion.semantic_chunking`
