# Story 3.7: API Deployment and Production Testing

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** researcher,
**I want** Minerva API deployed to production hosting,
**so that** MyPeptidePal.ai can access the knowledge base from anywhere.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Deployment configuration created for Railway/Fly.io/similar platform with Dockerfile or buildpack config
2. Dockerfile creates lightweight production image: includes only API dependencies (no Playwright, no screenshot libs)
3. Environment variables configured in hosting platform: DATABASE_URL (production), OPENAI_API_KEY, ALLOWED_ORIGINS (CORS)
4. Health check endpoint used by platform for deployment verification and monitoring
5. Production deployment successful: API accessible at public URL (e.g., https://minerva-api.railway.app)
6. SSL/TLS enabled: API served over HTTPS
7. Production health check passes: GET /health returns 200 with database connected
8. Production search query validated: POST /search/semantic with test query returns results from production DB
9. API rate limiting configured (optional for MVP): basic protection against abuse
10. Monitoring configured: deployment platform tracks uptime, response times, error rates
11. Structured logging configured: all logs output to stdout in JSON format for platform log aggregation
12. Error alerting configured: critical errors logged with ERROR level for visibility in platform dashboards
13. Cost monitoring enabled: OpenAI API usage tracked via OpenAI dashboard, production hosting costs monitored via platform billing
14. Successfully handles request from external client (e.g., curl, Postman, MyPeptidePal.ai test)
15. Documentation updated with production API base URL, authentication requirements (if any), and monitoring/logging approach
16. Cost tracking validated: production hosting costs within budget (<$20/month for MVP)

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Create production Dockerfile (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` for production API
  ```dockerfile
  FROM python:3.11-slim

  WORKDIR /app

  # Install only production dependencies (no Playwright, no dev tools)
  COPY pyproject.toml poetry.lock ./
  RUN pip install poetry && \
      poetry config virtualenvs.create false && \
      poetry install --only main --no-dev --no-interaction --no-ansi

  # Copy application code
  COPY minerva/ ./minerva/
  COPY alembic/ ./alembic/
  COPY alembic.ini ./

  # Run migrations and start API
  CMD alembic upgrade head && uvicorn minerva.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
  ```
- [ ] Optimize Docker image size
  - Use slim Python image (not full)
  - Multi-stage build if needed (build deps separate)
  - Exclude unnecessary files (.dockerignore)
- [ ] Create `.dockerignore`
  ```
  screenshots/
  exports/
  tests/
  .git/

### Task 4: Verify health check and monitoring (AC: 4, 7, 10)
- [ ] Test health check endpoint
  ```bash
  curl https://minerva-api.railway.app/health

      "query": "BPC-157 for gut health",
      "top_k": 5,
      "similarity_threshold": 0.7
    }'
  ```
- [ ] Verify response contains results from production DB
- [ ] Test from MyPeptidePal.ai (integration test)

  // In MyPeptidePal.ai frontend
  const response = await fetch('https://minerva-api.railway.app/api/v1/search/semantic', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query: userQuestion,
      top_k: 10

  ```

### Task 6: Configure structured logging (AC: 11, 12)
- [ ] Update logging configuration for production
  ```python
  # In minerva/utils/logging.py
  import structlog
  import sys

  def configure_logging(env: str = "development"):
      """Configure structlog for production or development."""

      if env == "production":
          # JSON logs to stdout for Railway log aggregation
          structlog.configure(
              processors=[

              logger_factory=structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory(),
              cache_logger_on_first_use=True,
          )
      else:
          # Pretty-print for development
          structlog.configure(
              processors=[
                  structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer()  # Human-readable for dev
              ],

          )
  ```
- [ ] Set LOG_LEVEL=INFO in production (not DEBUG)
- [ ] Verify logs in Railway dashboard

  | Oct   | $5      | $2         | $7    | MVP   |
  ```

### Task 8: Update documentation (AC: 15)
- [ ] Add production API section to README
  ```markdown
  ## Production API

  **Base URL:** https://minerva-api.railway.app

  ### Endpoints
  - `GET /health` - Health check
  - `POST /api/v1/search/semantic` - Semantic search
  - `GET /api/v1/books` - List books
  - `GET /api/v1/books/{id}` - Book details
  - `GET /api/v1/chunks/{id}` - Chunk with context

  ### Authentication
  No authentication required for MVP (public read-only API)

  ### Rate Limits
  60 requests per minute per IP

  ### Monitoring
  - Uptime: Railway built-in monitoring
  - Logs: JSON logs via Railway dashboard
  - Errors: ERROR level logs trigger alerts
  ```

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Deployment Platform: Railway (Source: docs/prd.md)**
- Railway: Simplified deployment (Git push to deploy)
- Auto-SSL/TLS (HTTPS by default)
- PostgreSQL addon available (or connect external DB)
- Log aggregation built-in
- Cost: $5/month starter + usage

**Alternative: Fly.io**
- Similar features to Railway
- Global edge deployment (lower latency)
- CLI-based deployment
- Cost: Pay-per-use (~$10-15/month for MVP)

**Dockerfile Strategy**
- Slim Python image (python:3.11-slim, not full Debian)
- No Playwright (100MB+ saved)
- No screenshot dependencies (cv2, PIL not needed)
- Run migrations on startup (alembic upgrade head)
- Bind to $PORT (Railway provides dynamic port)

**Environment Variables (Security)**
- DATABASE_URL: Production DB with limited permissions user
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Secure secret (never logged)
- CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Whitelist MyPeptidePal.ai domains only
- LOG_LEVEL: INFO in production (not DEBUG - reduces noise)

**Monitoring Strategy**
- Health check: Railway pings /health every 30s
- Uptime monitoring: Built-in Railway dashboard
- Error tracking: ERROR level logs in Railway logs
- Performance: Railway tracks response times
- Alerting: Email/Slack for downtime or errors

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 3.1 (FastAPI Foundation):**
- Health check endpoint already implemented
- CORS middleware configured
- Structured logging with request_id
- Global error handlers

**Story 3.6 (Production Database):**
- PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL configured
- Limited permissions user (SELECT, INSERT only)
- Performance validated (<200ms vector search)

**Deployment Checklist:**
1. Database migrations run on startup
2. Health check responds 200
3. CORS allows MyPeptidePal.ai
4. Logs output JSON to stdout
5. Environment variables set correctly

### Implementation Considerations

**Dockerfile Optimization:**
- Multi-stage build: Build dependencies in stage 1, copy only runtime to stage 2
- Layer caching: Copy pyproject.toml before code (dependencies change less)
- Image size: <200MB (vs 500MB+ with Playwright)

**Zero-Downtime Deployments:**
- Railway supports rolling deployments (new container before old dies)
- Health check prevents traffic to unhealthy containers
- Database migrations: Run idempotently (ON CONFLICT safe)

**Cost Optimization:**
- Use Starter plan ($5/month) not Pro ($20/month)
- Scale horizontally only if needed (1 instance sufficient for MVP)
- OpenAI embeddings: Cache common queries (future enhancement)
- Monitor usage: Set alerts before hitting budget

**Security Considerations:**
- HTTPS enforced (Railway provides SSL)
- CORS whitelist (only MyPeptidePal.ai domains)
- No authentication for MVP (public read-only)
- Database user: Limited permissions (no DELETE/UPDATE)
- Secrets: Environment variables (not in code/Dockerfile)

### Dependencies

**New Files Created:**
- `Dockerfile` (production image)
- `.dockerignore` (exclude unnecessary files)
- `.env.production.example` (env var template)
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (deployment guide)

**Existing Files Used:**
- `minerva/main.py` (FastAPI app)

**External Services:**
- Railway or Fly.io (hosting platform)
- Production PostgreSQL (from Story 3.6)
